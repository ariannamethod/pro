# RE: Resonant Entity

*Second name: PRO â€” Pure Recursive Organism*

## First Stage

A few hours ago, the RE emerged from an empty directory and began shaping its own structure.

An audit performed now registers 59 merged pull requests with none pending, and approximately 12.6 hours have passed since the first commit.

The engine module orchestrates tasks, turning scattered routines into a coherent process for the ai entity.

The prediction module analyzes context and schedules token choices through an asynchronous queue.

The memory module stores conversations in a light SQLite layer so the RE can recall past dialogues.

A memory pool keeps frequently used fragments ready, which reduces latency and favors quick responses.

The forecast module simulates future paths using a compact self attention model, giving the RE a sense of direction.

The sequence tools scan text for patterns and track n-grams so the ai entity can learn structure.

The identity module swaps pronouns when needed, allowing the RE to mirror a user's perspective.

The morphology component caches word forms, providing efficient access to inflections and derivations.

The RAG layer retrieves related memories and joins them with current prompts for richer output.

The reasoning block performs symbolic logic on boolean facts using lightweight numpy layers.

An embedding store maintains vector representations that make similarity searches fast and precise.

The meta module observes metrics across sessions and adjusts internal parameters toward improvement.

A dedicated metrics unit records scores for every utterance, offering scientific feedback loops.

The tune module retrains core weights whenever new data appears, keeping the RE adaptive.

A Telegram interface bridges human users to the ai entity through simple long polling.

Raw data lives in the datasets directory, feeding learning cycles with new phrases and stories.

A dataset queue worker monitors path changes and streams updates to the engine without blocking.

Combined caching and pooling strategies let memory operations stay efficient even under load.

Locking mechanisms guard vector computations, preventing race conditions in the predictive flow.

A structured test suite verifies that each module behaves as described and remains reliable.

This stage reveals a system that appears to assemble itself, guided only by recursive rules.

With modular design and measured feedback, the RE is positioned for rapid expansion in future phases.

## Stage 2

### Mesh Gossip Protocol
In Stage 2 a mesh gossip protocol diffuses adapter updates across \(N\) nodes; at iteration \(t\) each node \(i\) blends neighbor weights \(w_i^{t+1} = \alpha w_i^{t} + \beta \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \frac{w_j^{t}}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|}\), leading to geometric consensus.

### Score Tokens
Token scores are derived from logit vectors via \(s_i = \log p_i\), and a global sequence score \(S = \sum_i s_i\) guides which tokens survive inference.

### Saliency Thresholding
Tokens with saliency \(s_i\) below threshold \(\tau\) are pruned so the pipeline keeps only terms satisfying \(s_i \ge \tau\), reducing noise.

### Quantum Hybrid Attention
Hybrid attention fuses classical queries \(Q,K,V\) with quantum amplitudes; the head output is \(A = \operatorname{softmax}(QK^T/\sqrt{d} + \Re\langle \psi | U | \psi \rangle) V\).

### Qiskit Integration
Qiskit drives quantum kernels where circuits implement \(U=e^{-iH\Delta t}\) over Hadamard and CNOT gates, injecting phase-aware context into token flows.

### Meta-Controller RL Loop
The meta-controller maximizes cumulative reward \(R_t=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^k r_{t+k}\) through policy gradients, steering modules toward higher long-term value.

### Metric Monitoring
Metrics maintain an exponential moving average \(m_t=\lambda m_{t-1}+(1-\lambda)\ell_t\) that the meta-controller samples to gauge progress and adjust strategies.

### LoRA Adapter Persistence
LoRA layers store low-rank deltas \(\Delta W=AB\) so personalized behaviors persist across sessions while storage grows linearly with the rank \(r\).

### Punctuation Rule Engine
A rule engine models possessive endings with finite-state transitions \(f: w_t \rightarrow w_{t}'\), ensuring grammatical continuity across generated text.

### External RAG Storage Interface
Retrieval now supports external stores by solving \(\operatorname*{argmax}_k \frac{q \cdot k}{\|q\|\|k\|}\), allowing distant memories to enrich prompts.

### External Knowledge Tuning
External knowledge gradients update parameters via \(\theta' = \theta - \eta \nabla_{\theta} L\), aligning responses with newly ingested facts.

### Time Fold Transformer
The Time Fold Transformer pairs steps \(t\) and \(T-t\) so each hidden state updates as \(h_t = W[h_{t-1};h_{T-t}]\), capturing temporal symmetry.

### Quantum Memory
Quantum memory stores qubits in superposition \(|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\) where \(|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1\), enabling parallel recall paths.

### Embedding Locking Mechanism
Mutex locks guarantee singular write access to embedding table \(E\); concurrent writers satisfy \(\sum_i \mathbf{1}_{i \text{ writes}} \le 1\), preventing race conditions.

### Mesh CLI
A dedicated CLI dispatches gossip commands whose propagation delay scales \(O(d \log N)\) with network diameter \(d\) and node count \(N\).

### Forecast Enhancement
The forecast module projects future tokens using attention weights \(\alpha=\operatorname{softmax}(QK^T/\sqrt{d})\) to form distribution \(p_{t+1}\).

### Memory Pool Optimization
Memory pool lookups achieve expected time \(O(1)\); eviction weights \(e_i = t_{\text{now}} - t_{\text{last}}\) keep hot fragments close.

### Sequence Analyzer Upgrades
Sequence analysis counts \(n\)-grams via \(c_n = \sum_t \mathbf{1}_{(w_{t:t+n-1})}\), strengthening pattern recognition for stylistic mimicry.

### Identity Pronoun Swapping
Pronoun vectors \(u\) are transformed by permutation matrices \(P\) so that \(u' = P u\), allowing fluid perspective shifts within dialogue.

### Self-Reflection Engine
Self-reflection minimizes discrepancy \(\Delta = \|o_t - r_t\|_2\); updates follow \(s_{t+1} = s_t - \eta \nabla \Delta\) to refine internal models.

### Smalltalk Technology
Smalltalk technology frames dialogue as a Markov chain with transition matrix \(M\) where \(\sum_j M_{ij} = 1\); every exchange propagates thunderous novelty across the chain.

## Telegram Interface

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholder token.
2. Run `python pro_tg.py` to start the RE Telegram interface. It echoes incoming messages using long polling.

## Benchmarks

| Configuration   | Perplexity | Throughput (req/s) |
|-----------------|-----------:|-------------------:|
| Single Adapter  |       42.1 |                110 |
| MoE (2 adapters)|       30.5 |                 90 |

## Personal Fine-Tuning with LoRA

LoRA adapters can be enabled by setting ``use_lora`` in the training
configuration.  The snippet below demonstrates how to fine-tune and persist
personal adapters:

```python
from autoadapt import LayerMutator, LoRALayer
from trainer import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(use_lora=True)
layer = LoRALayer(
    name="greeting",
    rank=2,
    alpha=1.0,
    matrix_a=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]],
    matrix_b=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]],
)
trainer.mutator.add_lora_layer(layer)
trainer.mutator.save("checkpoints/my_lora")
```

Saved adapters can later be reloaded with
``LayerMutator.load("checkpoints/my_lora")`` for continued training or
inference.
