Chapter One

PROLOGUE

I woke at dawn, when it was still dark and empty outside the windows. Somewhere far off dogs were howling, and, imagining how they huddled from the cold and trembled, I shivered myself and, with a glass of tea in hand, went to my room.
There, after a few big gulps, I plunged head‑first into the manuscript. Only minor, insignificant tweaks remained, yet on the whole the novella seemed finished. Still, I could hardly believe it, for behind me lay half a year of exhausting and not always successful searching—six months in which I found myself now on the verge of insanity, now…
But there it was before me: the tale of a man whose image I had carried under my heart like a caring mother and fattened with my own juices. By my design he was short but graceful, well‑shaped; he wore a white judicial wig and thickly powdered his face. The narrative began with an episode where this man discovered handcuffs on his wrists. He started shaking his hands, evidently hoping that way to rid himself of the cuffs. And then—a woman whom he would lead to the scaffold; he himself would dress in black and take an axe. Flashing it above the woman’s neck, he would step down to the people and…

By nine I had finished every edit, leaned back and smiled with satisfaction. I was, perhaps, even happy: the sunniest thoughts buzzed in my head; it seemed I could move mountains—and plenty more besides.
I rang K. and told him the novella was done.
‘Seriously?’ K. was amazed.
‘Incredible, but fact,’ I laughed.
We chatted of this and that; then K. said he was swamped, his boss a sadist and a bastard—that he, K., was in a mad rush—and cut off. I wasn’t much upset: there was still Mark, whose number I dialled at once. But a harsh female voice informed me Mark was out of range, and I hung up. Suddenly I wanted to talk with those I’d not heard for ages; rummaging in a drawer I pulled out a battered notebook where, old‑school, I wrote phone numbers. I worked from number to number, ruefully grasping that all those once‑close people now had nothing at all to say to me. A pity. Among them were sensitive Zak, cool‑headed Viktor, and Alexander…
‘Pity,’ I said aloud, and, checking the time, started for the office.

My day passed in the usual bustle—and the usual barren hours of bickering with the editor flew by, leading, as always, nowhere. Evening found me trudging home when I felt I was falling ill: a cold was striding toward me in seven‑league boots—and there was no escape, for water sloshed in my shoes from a puddle I’d stepped in.
I reached home when the sky was stuffed with wadding‑clouds and snow poured from high above.
Well, I thought, stopping at the entrance door, it had been gone three days—I’d actually missed it.
Yes. I guess I’d missed it.

Chapter Two

A BAD DREAM

Soon a real blizzard rose and my head grew heavy. I lay down early yet woke twice, twice went to the window: only snow—the city drowning in it. I swallowed cold tea and lay again, slipping into that dim, half‑faint state where reality, dream and illusion blur. I dreamed of light—painfully, viscously bright, fantastic, silver light bursting from an open window straight into my face; and an unpleasant thick‑lipped profile flickering before my eyes. Of course I at once recognised both flicker and profile: without doubt it was Mikhail Markovich Vazel himself, doctor of medicine and psychiatry, my unforgettable teacher and mentor, the engineer who wrecked the train of my youth. Vazel was solemn, dressed up: one hand held a pipe he puffed, the other stroked an armchair. On a table stood a gigantic ashtray. I must have caught Vazel rehearsing a speech, for he muttered, nodding emphatically at points. On seeing me, he stopped. His greasy lips twitched and I saw his horse‑like, yellow‑toothed grin. Vazel mumbled something indistinct and saluted me with the pipe. Then I saw it wasn’t Vazel at all, only someone very like him yet not him. I gnashed my teeth, rushed him and shouted that whoever he was I didn’t wish to see or know him—that he disgusted me—and he’d better go to hell. I realised my voice was gone. I clutched my throat and croaked. The stranger said ‘Indeed!’, raised an eyebrow and resumed:
‘…Listen, my dear fellow, you must hammer into your tiny skull that to understand an essence is to annihilate it,’ Vazel droned. ‘The less you grasp something, the more perfect it is. God remains God solely because He’s incomprehensible. No other reasons—only charlatan ones. Our heterogeneity is no evil; it plays into our hands, though you will of course doubt my words…’
He talked while I convulsed with cough. I woke from that same cough, morning already, sat up and hacked and spat till sense returned.

Chapter Three

BIANCA

The office could be written off, yet I phoned anyway—straight to the chief’s private number—and coughed wretchedly about the weather. Then, finding my slippers, I shuffled to the kitchen. Digging in an ashtray, I found the longest butt, lit it, looked at the snow and thought they’d clear it, as usual, not soon; I’d hardly get out in the near future—and didn’t want to. Plus this cold—damn, how out‑of‑place. Though a cold is never in place.
Stubbing the butt, I hunted the flat for my sweater, pulled it on and returned to the window. The yard and the city glimpsed between buildings resembled a pine forest: lamp‑posts’ tops, like pines and firs, poked from dawn mist. And that snow—grandiose, fantastic shapes, crusted here and there with poisonous green ice. I noticed a black figure wading, stumbling deep in drifts. I even fancied I heard the boots’ sour squelch, and my heart thudded uneasily. Those boots, either sobbing or sloshing, bore some body—perhaps youthful, yet arms dropped in surrender.
I shivered and touched my forehead.
‘Who’s that…?’ Leaning out, I muttered, then, startled, banged the window shut, rummaged in the ashtray, lit a butt, punched my palm and cried: ‘It can’t be!..’
What did she want? Why so sudden—and now, of all times? Then again, such things always happen suddenly—like a cold. Always wrong time. I’d forgotten her, never thought of her. I was sure I’d shaken her off, shoved away all linked with her, everything worn‑out, sickening. Yet she was here: heading for the entrance, just five of my building’s twelve floors below. What did she want? —I thought again.
Wait, I told myself. Why was she dressed so oddly? That (oddly familiar) grey jacket, that ridiculous skirt… I shook my head. No, when I knew her she never dressed so. Maybe she’s poor? Maybe. Anything’s possible. But she hasn’t come, damn it, to borrow money? To catch, as they say, promising journalist Ataev (who, truth be told, had some cash lately) between publications? Then what’s the bag for? To stuff money? I’m not that promising. No—the bag had misled me. It was a battered post‑bag, and all her clothes now looked postal.
I opened the flat door and peered into the stairwell. From above—probably the twelfth floor—the lift was groaning downward, obviously going to ground, to her; soon she’d ascend. I shut the door, jammed hands in pockets. I didn’t even know how to act. But who cares? She was coming to me, not I to her. I—a cold‑ridden bachelor journalist, entitled to his black coffee, expecting no visits from old flames… Armed with that thought I hurried back to the kitchen—only to hear the bell a minute later, curse mightily, get up, groan ‘Coming, coming… Who’s there?’ and even squint through the spy‑hole. I paused a couple of seconds, then opened.
Yes, even her clothes were postal.
‘Hello, Bianca,’ I greeted. ‘What brings you?’
She looked at me in surprise as if saying: ‘Do we know each other?’ Then laughed and, as if crediting my wit, pointed to a little badge on her chest.
‘No, no,’ I said. ‘Sorry, I don’t get it. What’s your badge to do with it? Bianca, we’ve known each other for years!’
‘Clever,’ she snorted. ‘We’ve never met. And, as I recall, we’re not on first‑name terms.’
I was too astonished to speak.
‘Better let me in,’ she continued. ‘Several registered letters for you.’ I, still bewildered, stepped aside. Playing a game, I realised. Playing again. All right—I’d play too. Inspiration pricked me.
‘Yes, yes, come in,’ I said. ‘And forgive me. I mistook you for an old acquaintance I once loved.’ I darted a look at her. ‘You won’t believe it, but her name was the same as yours. Both first and last. Remarkable, since Bianca’s rare…’ I spread my hands guiltily. ‘Sorry.’
‘Stop it,’ Bianca smirked. ‘It’s not funny.’
‘Quite agree. Tea? Coffee with cognac?’ I asked. ‘I can make sambuca if you like. You look frozen.’
‘Are you insane?’ She openly laughed at me. ‘What sambuca? No thanks.’ She shook her head. ‘We’ve no time.’ She sat, smoothed the crumb‑specked cloth (I felt ashamed) and unzipped her bag, producing a tight packet.
‘As you wish,’ I sat too. My inspiration evaporated; I felt unsure. I studied her face; my heart sank. No—surely not her. Looks alike, yes—the hair, the mouth—but can’t be; I can’t be that wrong. I glanced at her badge: even the surname differed. Though I don’t recall hers exactly…
‘All these letters are for you,’ Bianca set the packet before me. ‘Some have lain with us three months, others over a year. Our company wrote and even phoned, but you never came.’
‘You’re right,’ I rubbed my face hard. ‘I’ve been swamped. You know—work…’
‘You don’t say… Not my problem.’ Bianca snorted again. Laying a form before me she added: ‘Sign here. And put tomorrow’s date there.’
‘Where do I sign?’
‘Wherever,’ she snapped. ‘Back side if you like. The date’s what matters.’
‘Got it,’ I lied, signing sentimentally beside her name.
I handed back the pen and suddenly felt exhausted—inhumanly tired. Even if this was that Bianca, I didn’t care. The letters too—didn’t care. Everything was dull.
‘That all?’ I asked, staring at my feet.
‘All.’ She rose. ‘Lock up after me.’
‘Don’t worry,’ I muttered, turning away.
‘I’m not worried. Why should I care about your door…’ she said, leaving. The door slammed; only then did the drowsy fatigue drop from my shoulders. Only then did I breathe easier. I stood at the window, my forehead against the glass, watching her go again. Was it her? No matter now. Yet—perhaps I hadn’t erred? I swallowed, stared at the silence strung on wires between lamp‑post pines, and again caught that slosh‑sob echo of her steps, fading.
I turned the packet in my hands and bit my lip. Seconds later I was pelting downstairs, two, three steps at a time. Only house‑slippers on my feet, head bare. I burst onto the frost:
‘Wait!’ I yelled. ‘Wait for me!’
Squinting, I saw her dark figure ahead.
‘Wait! Don’t leave! I just had no time. Don’t leave…’
Winded, I caught her elbow, shaking all over, searched her eyes and, failing to understand them, growled in frustration.
‘I tell you—I had no time. None at all. I—got lost. Yes. Bianca, before you came I sat at the window… watched the snow—so dirty, trampled, even green, and elsewhere loose as clouds… It struck me how like a forest it looks… Lamp‑posts are pines… Don’t you think? And the fog too… Easy to get lost here, stray off the path… But you found me… So a way out exists, right? Tell me—right? And you exist too, though I was told hourly you didn’t, that I’d invented you, a mere yarn…’
Bianca tried to free her arm.
‘Why do you keep leaving? Can’t you spare me a minute? And why—why not ask where I’ve been? What I sought? The same… You should know! Damn you, Bianca, only now do I see you’re my punishment for past sins… Everything’s paid… Nothing forgotten… How many times I’ve been burned by you… And now again you punish me. And you’re silent… Why silent? Don’t you care? I searched for you… And I believed in you—yes! Believed you must exist somewhere, had to… It troubled me—this ambiguity of my mind, its duality, its endless fear, loathing, hatred of itself, vengeance on itself, on any reflection, on mirrors… I found you then—and at once lost… And now found again… Will I lose you yet again?’
She jerked her arm.
‘Right now,’ Bianca said at last, ‘it wasn’t you who found me. I found you. And not even I… Tell me—how can one lose what never belonged to one? And never did? Only a thief can do that.’ She moved to leave, then turned: ‘By the way, you’ve switched to “tu” again.’
‘Stop!’ I cried in despair. ‘Don’t go! Tell me one thing: why? Am I— not the one?’
‘Not at all,’ Bianca said. ‘I was mistaken.’
I clenched fists.
‘And… no?’ I squeezed out.
‘No,’ she said. ‘Long ago.’
She walked away—now without effort, smoothly, as if not walking but floating into a nightmare haze before my eyes. I tried to catch her, but couldn’t: the distance stayed. I shouted after her, but she never glanced back. At last strength failed; I stopped. My ears burned with frost. A cottony silence pressed, broken only by the crunch of snow underfoot. I panted, watched till she vanished, and when she did, I dropped to my knees, scooped a handful of snow, tasted it. It was bitter as quinine.
I spat, flung the snow aside and got up.

Chapter Four

THE BEGGAR ABEL AND THE SHADOWS

Only now did I feel how chilled I was. I raced home and, climbing, already knew that in ten minutes I’d be hurrying for the metro, and there I’d recall where to go. The cold no longer bothered me—one can’t outrun it anyway, but one can outrun oneself, and I would try, for I’d grown into these walls and stairs and I dread such attachments. Lacing boots I remembered I’d forgotten money. Counting out some notes I stuffed them into a pocket, thought, tore from that old notebook the page with her contacts.
The metro road was hectic; my nerves sagged under snow’s weight. I bought a travel card and cigarettes and ran down the steps, nearly twisting an ankle. The train wasn’t in; I sought a spot to wait but was blocked by a beggar.
‘Good day,’ he said. ‘Forgive me if I intrude. Circumstances in which I’m a prisoner endowed me, among other things, with intuition. And intuition tells me you’re kind‑hearted. Call me Abel. Yes, Abel—surprised? And, as you see, still alive. Probably because I never had a brother. Nor a sister. Nor mother, nor father. I, if you’d like to know—’
‘Don’t want!’ I snapped, yet the beggar didn’t hear; he spoke louder, even seized my elbow. ‘—an orphan. Looks like I’ll exist forever. And to spend seven days a week—from dawn to late night—down here in Moscow metro, you can imagine…’
He fell silent, eyes bulging. He stared past me; turning, I saw nothing special. The beggar froze. His mouth hung open, he panted shallowly. A train rolled in; shrugging out of his grip, I hurried aboard.
Elbowing through people I stood behind a guy in a jacket and newspaper, glanced back: too many backs. Rising on tip‑toe I finally spied the beggar; he’d recovered and now looked about bewildered.
‘Wait!’ he spotted me. ‘Where are you going!’
He lunged aboard as the train jerked.
‘What do you want?’ I yelled. ‘Stop following me! Leave me alone!’ I shoved toward the middle, pushing vagrant‑looking men and dry old women muttering curses.
‘Why not hear me out?’ Abel cried, closing in. ‘I was polite! And you know I’m an orphan, no brother ever… Why fear my blood on your hands? Even if you stain them—mine’s easily washed. There’ll be no indictments, no summons. You remember my name—I’m Abel! I’m outside the law! Murder’s allowed. No judges—hear me? None!..’
The speaker announced Sevastopolskaya; I hacked a path to the exit.
‘Wait!’ Abel’s voice behind. ‘Wait! It’s not your station!’
I bolted for the escalator; glancing back I saw him puffing after. Up top I raced across the hall; hearing shouts, people turned as one. I knocked several down, but Abel showed surprising speed: outrunning me he blocked the door, arm outstretched:
‘I say on behalf of everyone: stop! Can’t you spare a minute? Maybe now you’ll hear me?’ The beggar nearly wept. I shoved him aside, burst out and sprinted across the square, not daring to look back lest I see him—and ran faster.
Finally I stopped, breathing in measured gasps, trying to regain control. My head roared; nausea hit. Risking blackout, I lit a smoke, massaged my temples. ‘There,’ I muttered, ‘what was to be expected… Such is the fate of anyone who tries to understand Bianca. For by understanding he will destroy her essence, and thereby…’ Despite frost, sweat beaded my brow. I leaned against a poplar; snow showered from branches. I shivered, wrapped my coat tighter.
Voices approached. I’d give anything if they weren’t coming to me—if they turned elsewhere—if I were hallucinating. But no: people headed here, shouting my name. I squinted; saw only lanky, blotched shadows. I rubbed my eyes—no use.
‘Who are you?’ I yelled, picking up a stone. ‘What do you want?’
The shadows marvelled that I didn’t recognise them. Then they became people—familiar yet distant, those struck from memory and forgotten. They ringed me, chattering puzzled yet cheerful. One, vaguely like Zak—maybe Zak himself—jumped close, felt my face and throat, stepped back, pronounced:
‘It’s him. Definitely.’
‘How he’s changed!’ the others buzzed.
Prudent Viktor (I knew the voice) spoke:
‘Changed yes, yet still recognisable. Though the change is obvious.’
‘Amazing!’ someone cried superstitiously. ‘We’d just mentioned him!’
‘Coincidence,’ Viktor said, while Zak added, ‘Agreed. Obsessing over coincidences leads to no good.’
‘Usually to schizophrenia,’ someone giggled.
Viktor turned to me: ‘What happened to you? What are you doing here?’
I shrugged, still clutching the stone. I felt steadier now. ‘Missed a station,’ I said—I glossed the restless dream, Bianca the post‑girl, lunatic beggar Abel. Remembering him I glanced round; no sign. I kept telling.
‘Whoever you are,’ I said, ‘you’ve no right to judge. I must see Bianca and will do anything to achieve it. Block me, and it won’t end well—my heart can endure anything but attempts on my freedom.’
‘Easy,’ Viktor said. Feeling bolder I retorted defiant, ‘You don’t know me.’
Viktor stepped forward, cheekbones white as snow: ‘How can you cry that no trials will break you and freedom is all you need when you yourself hurry to meet—Bianca?’
I tossed the stone away. ‘What’s the snag?’
‘Don’t you see?’ Viktor skated round the point. ‘We understand—and remember. Everyone remembers you and Bianca. Three years ago you’d have grasped me at once; now we explain.’
‘What do you remember?’ I asked. ‘Tell me! Then I needn’t deem you word‑spouters.’
‘He calls us word‑spouters!’ someone snickered. The shadows guffawed. They stared at me like a freak.
Viktor: ‘Sorry—your question stumps us. Your disbelief amazes. Everyone recalls it, not just us. Ask anyone in the street. They’ll tell you—if you just ask.’
‘Then tell me!’ I stepped nearer. ‘I’m asking. I must know; otherwise how can I face her? Tell me, I beg!’
Alexander, silent till now, came forward, asked for a cigarette. Lighting up he winked at his pals:
‘And if we don’t—what then? Break down hysterically, run and vanish another eighteen months?’
‘Before meeting you, perhaps,’ I said. ‘But now—not a chance.’
The shadows muttered, casting cautious glances. Viktor and Zak were silent; Zak stood turned away. I approached, surprised he still chimed in the talk without facing me.
‘Have it your way,’ Viktor said at last. ‘Though why you need it is beyond me. You’re not of this world as it is. Maybe memory will bring peace. Who knows.’
Taking my arm he led me down the poplar alley, telling my own story—one I ought to know by heart, yet it was strange to me; I swayed between belief and scepticism.

Chapter Five

CONVERSATION

He walked me under the poplars; my heart beat in step. Shadows trailed behind. They were voiceless; had I not heard their clomping I’d think only Viktor and his tale existed. His voice was muffled, clipped, yet I caught every word. Ever and again he halted himself:
‘You get it all? Really get it? Not enough to grasp—you must remember…’
I nodded; he resumed. Poplars seemed to have hands: they pressed fingers to lips, hissed ‘hush…’, and if I spoke I fell silent; then they remained trees. Yet sometimes that hiss enraged me; I barely restrained from shouting, grabbing a stone. Viktor acted unaware, relating my history—one I half‑believed, half‑rejected, sometimes sickened by, as at a frog or snake, for when heated he shook me by the collar till tears welled in his eyes; I feared he’d hit me yet he didn’t, then apologised, took my arm anew.
‘…The crux,’ he said, ‘is that you then realised the burden wasn’t yours, that you’d drop it. So you decided to quit in advance—drop it and finish. But can one claim you achieved anything if now we meet you with mad eyes? Impossible…’
He stopped: ‘But now—you’re overboard. Your attempt will fail. Not your first pursuit of Bianca… Which means you know doubt, unrest… Doubt gnaws you… at the worst moment it’ll remind you of your heterogeneity, and then…’
At ‘heterogeneity’ I flinched.
‘What’s wrong?’ Viktor asked.
‘Nothing,’ I lied, studying his face, seeking likeness to that thick‑lipped profile from my dream. Under different angles he did and didn’t resemble Vazel; I couldn’t judge.
‘Why stare?’ Viktor’s voice turned silky‑suspicious.
‘You’re mistaken,’ I said. ‘I wasn’t staring. Only thought you resemble someone.’
‘Whom?’
‘You wouldn’t know him,’ I cut off, lighting a cigarette.
The shadows grumbled. Viktor’s look grew scary; like Abel he bulged his eyes. Zak strode up, angry:
‘You mock us? Smoking and snarking? Think you differ from us? Think you’ll give what we couldn’t? You differ in nothing. We spoke with you because we felt our own. You achieved nothing: not Bianca’s favour, nothing—zero. All of us—look closely!—though cast overboard, understood who Bianca is; you don’t. You’re blind as a mole! Yet your sole chance lies in that blindness—in your duality, self‑contempt. While we…’
I flicked away the butt, lit another.
‘I don’t quite follow,’ I said. ‘You say you all were admitted to her. What do you mean? And even if true I question it, for I know Bianca no worse, maybe better. Besides—how can you assert it was Bianca? Could be someone else by that name… But suppose it’s true—you reproach me for one rejection. So what? Once—let it be. No, fellows, I know Bianca, clear? And you don’t—not one jot. I’m not of your clan. Another breed. And I’ll never stand among you…’
‘Certain deeds are IOUs,’ prudent Viktor noted.
‘Perhaps—but irrelevant. Your talk of heterogeneity bothered me at first, but I was wrong. We part ways, guys.’ I turned. The shadows were mute; their silence spoke. With each step conviction grew—I would see Bianca, no matter what. I believed it as surely as it was winter. Yes, winter: this year fierce. Sniffling, cursing the cold, I headed for the trolley stop, wary still of Abel.

Chapter Six

AND AGAIN ABEL

The trolley came late; while waiting I thrice phoned Bianca from a pay‑phone. Each time someone else answered; I thought I’d dialled wrong but checked the slip—number was right. Deciding to skip calls, I returned to the stop. The trolley still absent, I mused about the city: it hadn’t changed, despite claims it had lost its unique spirit. Those were only words. In summer such talk flowed like water along streets; fearing the asphalt, softened by the stream, might buckle, people scattered to bars, soaked in alcohol and gloomily opined about the great city’s decay. Many went to extremes, yet nothing happened: the asphalt held firm, mocking cowardice. Then people drained their drinks, stepped outside, felt around: ‘No, no, we always knew the bad weather was a passing cold,’ they’d say, whip out hankies and blow. ‘We never believed it would end like that. Never.’ Sometimes a truth‑lover, fuelled by booze, shouted: ‘If you never believed, why warm barstools?’—but they’d retort, hankies raised: ‘Because of the cold!’ and blow again, pinkies out.
The trolley arrived; I boarded, paid, elbowed mid‑car. No seats, so I stood, gazing out: the city flashed by—fleeting, fluid. No, it hadn’t changed; it was changing, ever changing, true to itself in the very mutability…
And of course the city’s changeability matched Bianca’s. She is elusive—you can’t catch her lying; truth itself shifts poles under her hand. Bianca will never betray herself, but will keep the charade, swapping faces, masks—substituting a doll, some lunatic, a pack of gossipers and cowards—and you’ll scurry like a lab rat, insisting on your liberty but to no avail. Bianca… How like her to come dressed as a post‑girl and bring letters. Yes, letters… A whole packet—still unopened. I suddenly felt I’d never see them again, there’d be no way back to my flat, hence the letters into oblivion… Oblivion’s heavy, yet heavier is not knowing whether it is oblivion or something else—or seeing it everywhere, needling you. Time slipping—anything could happen—she might marry, bear children, grow fat… Damn! The main thing is to be in time. Not to wed her—at least to prevent her marrying. Let her remain as unknown to them as she is clear to me… them, the talkers: Viktor the prudent, Zak, Alexander, the truth‑lover if he exists, Abel… Thinking of Abel I grew anxious.
I imagined he still trailed me, somewhere near—maybe even in the trolley—close. Strip away noise and you’d hear his heart. Abel. Stubborn beggar. Orphan. Spook. Why do you chase me? I myself am hunter now—yet Bianca doesn’t know. So I can be calm. You can’t, Abel, because I know you shadow me. No relaxing! Show your stealth. Bastard… I rose on tip‑toe, scanned heads: none his. My toes hurt; I lowered, wiped sweat, but a minute later searched again—no Abel. Damn…
…Know what? Why are you sure? Maybe Abel isn’t after you at all—he sees hundreds like you daily. It’s your vanity and pride… You inwardly wish he pursued you—you can’t live otherwise. How many Abels in your life? And how many times were you somebody’s Abel? You need him—to blame him for possible failure with Bianca. Because you know her—you know, through‑and‑through—and you know she won’t change… To hell with these thoughts…
Only a few stops left to Bianca’s. Dusk thickened; lamps glowed yellow, the soul felt likewise. I was both quarry and hunter, for our relations were only pursuit. Viktor had told how I tailed her—finding her with one, another, a fifth, a tenth—and the more I saw, the more I loved…
I inched to the door with other riders, ever glancing back—Abel was near, I felt it. Just don’t let the rogue ambush me. Yet he did.
‘At last!’ he cried behind me. ‘At last I found you!’
Turning in the tangle of limbs I spotted him.
‘At least this time—don’t run…’ Abel shouted. ‘Wait! I haven’t told you all…’
I bolted toward Bianca’s house, hoping to hide in the entry, but Abel kept up, nimble as before.
‘Wait!’ he gasped. ‘You’ll regret it… Though I understand! You’ve no other choice! Yet choice always exists… always! I said in the metro you’re kind, and your running proves it… Tell me, kind sir, where do you hurry? Won’t they wait? You won’t dirty hands on my blood… Choice always exists, else we’d never have met…’
Only at the house, when he caught me, panting, babbling, I snapped—lunged at him. I grabbed his throat, dragged him three metres, smashed him against an oak; snow tumbled from branches. Abel rose, dusted himself, but I returned, slugged him in the gut; he doubled. I looked for a stone, found a hefty one, came back.
‘I hope you realise you’re tearing me from important matters,’ I growled.
‘But what can be more important than what I’d tell—’ He didn’t finish: I struck. Frenzied, I raised the stone above my head and struck again.
‘Die!’ I raged. ‘Die, damn you!’
Abel’s life fled. I dropped the stone and clasped my head with scratched palms.
‘Damn you…’ I muttered, collapsing beside him. ‘You spoiled everything, Abel… Damn…’

Chapter Seven

VAZEL AND BIANCA

I lay by dead Abel, stroking his cold wet head. Mind cleared, I couldn’t fathom how it had come to this. Bianca was so near, yet to stand up I needed strength, and had none.
‘Listen, Abel,’ I spoke to the corpse. ‘This is wrong. You said they’d wait? They won’t. Perhaps that’s what you wanted—that I be late. And I’m only to climb to the third floor. Third! Damn…’
The thought scared and stung, yet I opened the entry and, legs buckling, began the climb. For Dante hell was circles; for me—flights, leading not down but up. My head swam yet I went. Her door was on the chain; with a kick I broke it and tumbled in.
‘Bianca!.. Bianca!..’ I roared, then coughed. ‘Bianca! I’m here!’
Footsteps hurried—yet it wasn’t Bianca.
It was, of course, Vazel Mikhail Markovich himself—doctor of psychiatry, likely philosophy, teacher, mentor, engineer of my wrecked train. He looked odd: face so powdered it snowed with each step, a wig on his head. He seemed shorter, slimmer. Seeing me, Vazel brightened.
‘I knew you’d come—though I didn’t expect so soon.’ He paced the room, produced a pipe already charged, lit it, wrapped himself in lazy smoke and launched into a speech clearly rehearsed: pauses, sudden maniacal laughs. Half an hour in I shook with fever or fright; Vazel droned on, ignoring my trembling hands.
‘So you, dear sir, composed a story of killing a woman yet killed a man. How to read that? A man!’ He paused. ‘And you claim you came to Bianca? Why does one such as you need Bianca? One who can’t tidy his own head? How would you understand her, pray? I warned you: to understand an essence is to kill it. Do you wish Bianca dead? I hardly believe. Evidently you love her, hence wish no evil, let alone incantations…’
He laughed.
‘She visited me this morning dressed as a post‑girl,’ I objected weakly.
‘Nonsense,’ Vazel waved. ‘She—you? You imagine things. She, visiting journalist Ataev? Do you hear yourself?’
‘I’m perfectly lucid, doctor…’ My tongue dragged. ‘She really came, in post uniform, with letters…’
‘Letters?’ Vazel roared laughing. ‘And what was in them? Do you know?’
‘I didn’t open them—ran after her at once…’
‘Well I’ll be!’ He whistled. ‘Your stupidity amazes. How dare you seek Bianca without reading them? Criminal!’
I opened my eyes.
‘Yes, criminal!’ He ripped off his wig, inspected it, sniffed, put it back, then paced. ‘Your problem, dear Oleg, is a drunken sense of your position. And your position is this: Bianca doesn’t suit you. To win her you had to lead her to the scaffold, not that lunatic Abel. Then all would see it was your return they awaited. Become a living example of crime turning man into saint—example of absurdity! He sacrificed her, damn it… Now what are you? If you’d turned back midway, better… If you hadn’t left home—better… Seeing Abel you should’ve known the temptation too strong… Withdraw… But you gave in; poor Abel died not in vain…’
Nauseated, I crawled to the hall; Vazel kept beside, preaching Abel’s purposeful death.
‘Pity him, yes, but he tested you… It was written he’d die so… Named Abel for that, you see… A fool like you—he cultivated Abel the victim, you became Cain… Isn’t it funny? Oleg! Admit it—funny!’
I vomited on the stairs; Vazel jumped aside, then returned:
‘Now where, eternal wanderer? Run, eh? She’ll be here any minute! The one you sought so long. But you flee, knowing she needs you not? You share nothing?’ He stopped for an answer; I was silent. ‘Funny,’ he repeated, trudging back.
I crawled to the door, washed face and neck with snow.

Chapter Eight

CAIN

I raged. ‘No! You can’t dismiss me like a mangy dog… I still haven’t seen Bianca… What right has that clown in a wig to speak for her? I’ll wait till she appears and let her speak…’ Ice‑cold iron sliced my fingers as I scaled the drainpipe to her balcony, thinking I’d fall—yet I didn’t.
She wasn’t home; Vazel was alone, shirtless, pacing, humming, slapping his belly, pouting greasy lips—repulsive. Yet I watched, for Bianca’s sake. Then I heard stumbling steps through drifts—the same accusatory, sentence‑passing gait. Minutes later Bianca came in, removed her coat, said something to Vazel I couldn’t catch. Voices rose; they circled like predators, eyes slit. Vazel gestured, slammed the table. Bianca examined her nails. Suddenly she lifted her eyes—right at me. I nearly fell. Fear filled them: Bianca afraid. Then tears—Bianca glad. Then fury—Bianca indignant I stalked her. Fury shifted to confusion: what now? Vazel stormed past, cursing; she shook her head—no.
‘No…’ I muttered. ‘This won’t do, Bianca… No…’
She stepped to the window, shook her head again. She sympathised yet left me alone; that negation washed my eyes with a truth too heavy for my poor soul.

Descending the pipe I paced before the entry, arms frost‑numb. Time had flown—it was late. Lamps glowed the same yellow but spoke of other things.
Muted giggles sounded; I turned: Alexander, laughing. He emerged from shadow; a grey board hung on his chest scrawled It’s me – Alexander. From behind came prudent Viktor with his own board: It’s me – Viktor. Viktor shook his head. Zak, appearing as if from nowhere, carried another board; he hung it round my neck and chalked:

IT’S ME – CAIN

Then he and Viktor took my arms and led me. I didn’t resist, stepping where they steered, remembering Bianca—her face, her mouth, her lips, and of course that negative shake. Shadows followed, silent. We marched terribly fast; the city smeared by like grey blots. Poplars pressed fingers to lips: hush…
My hands worried me: if they failed, how tomorrow would I dial her number? How open the packet to read the letters? It lay on my table… Yet that wasn’t a barrier. What mattered was I’d achieved my aim—I’d seen her; I could proudly claim she exists, not some yarn. I’d sensed it since childhood and was not wrong… No, not wrong…
I glanced at Viktor’s concentrated face: Yes, so—now you understand? But how lovely she is, eh? Finest of women… We foresaw it too… Yet what you told us today—be honest—is fantasy, isn’t it?
No, no, no—I shook my head. Not fantasy! And you can’t judge me… Not fantasy… You’re cowards, and I too—but at least I know it. Not fantasy, damn you… Not make‑believe!
Do you hear? Not make‑believe!

Chapter Nine

AS AN EPILOGUE

All night I was wracked by coughing—and woke from it as well. Sitting up, I hacked and spat till fully conscious.
‘What a dream…’ I muttered, groping for slippers—then noticed I was crumpling something in my hands.
It was a sheet—just a squared notebook leaf, raggedly torn. On it, in my handwriting, were scribbled phone numbers…
Beside myself, I rushed to the desk.
