# RE: Resonant Entity

*Second name: PRO â€” Pure Recursive Organism*

## First Stage

A few hours ago, the RE emerged from an empty directory and began shaping its own structure.

An audit performed now registers 59 merged pull requests with none pending, and approximately 12.6 hours have passed since the first commit.

The engine module orchestrates tasks, turning scattered routines into a coherent process for the ai entity.

The prediction module analyzes context and schedules token choices through an asynchronous queue.

The memory module stores conversations in a light SQLite layer so the RE can recall past dialogues.

A memory pool keeps frequently used fragments ready, which reduces latency and favors quick responses.

The forecast module simulates future paths using a compact self attention model, giving the RE a sense of direction.

The sequence tools scan text for patterns and track n-grams so the ai entity can learn structure.

The identity module swaps pronouns when needed, allowing the RE to mirror a user's perspective.

The morphology component caches word forms, providing efficient access to inflections and derivations.

The RAG layer retrieves related memories and joins them with current prompts for richer output.

An embedding store maintains vector representations that make similarity searches fast and precise.

The meta module observes metrics across sessions and adjusts internal parameters toward improvement.

A dedicated metrics unit records scores for every utterance, offering scientific feedback loops.

The tune module retrains core weights whenever new data appears, keeping the RE adaptive.

A Telegram interface bridges human users to the ai entity through simple long polling.

Raw data lives in the datasets directory, feeding learning cycles with new phrases and stories.

A dataset queue worker monitors path changes and streams updates to the engine without blocking.

Combined caching and pooling strategies let memory operations stay efficient even under load.

Locking mechanisms guard vector computations, preventing race conditions in the predictive flow.

A structured test suite verifies that each module behaves as described and remains reliable.

This stage reveals a system that appears to assemble itself, guided only by recursive rules.

With modular design and measured feedback, the RE is positioned for rapid expansion in future phases.

## Telegram Interface

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholder token.
2. Run `python pro_tg.py` to start the RE Telegram interface. It echoes incoming messages using long polling.
